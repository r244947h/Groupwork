App Name : TravelSphere – Experience Before You Go
Goal: Let users explore destinations interactively (via 360° views, videos, maps, weather, local attractions, and package previews) to help them decide before booking.

 STEP-BY-STEP DESIGN PROCESS
1. Define the Core Features
These are the essential modules your virtual tourism web app should include:
Feature	Description
🗺️Virtual Tour Viewer	Displays 360° panoramic images or videos of destinations (using tools like Google Street View API, or custom VR scenes).
📸 Gallery & Videos	Shows photos and short clips highlighting local experiences, accommodations, and attractions.
🏨 Package Preview	Lets users view accommodation types, prices, amenities, and booking links.
🕶️ VR/3D Mode (Optional)	Allows users to use VR headsets for immersive exploration (WebXR or Three.js).
🌦️ Live Info Section	Displays live weather, time zone, currency exchange, and nearby restaurants/landmarks.
💬 User Reviews	Shows testimonials, star ratings, and photos from past travelers.
🛒 Book or Enquire Button	Directs users to booking or enquiry pages after they’ve previewed the destination.

2. Choose Your Technology Stack
Use web tools that are lightweight but powerful:
Layer	Recommended Tools
Frontend (UI)	HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, React (for interactivity)
3D/VR Elements	A-Frame, Three.js, or WebXR
Backend (optional)	Node.js or Firebase (for saving user data, reviews, etc.)
APIs (for dynamic info)	Google Maps API, OpenWeather API, TripAdvisor API
Hosting	Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel (for front-end only); Firebase for dynamic apps

3. Design the User Flow
Here’s how users should experience the app:
1.	Landing Page:
o	Background video of destinations.
o	“Explore Now” button → leads to destination preview.
2.	Destination Preview Page:
o	Hero image or 360° view.
o	Tabs for “Attractions”, “Hotels”, “Reviews”, “Gallery”.
o	Side panel showing live info (weather, currency, time).
3.	Virtual Tour:
o	Clickable hotspots on the 360° image to “walk” around.
o	Optional voice narration or music.
4.	Booking or Enquiry Page:
o	After previewing, the user can choose a travel package, fill a form, or go to a booking partner (like Booking.com or your company’s checkout).
